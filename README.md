# 🚀 My MERN Stack Learning Journey

Hey there!
Welcome to my personal journey of becoming a **MERN Stack Developer** — one step at a time. This repo is like my digital diary, where I track everything I learn, build cool projects, and grow every single day.

## 📚 What is MERN?

**MERN** = **MongoDB** + **Express** + **React** + **Node.js**
It's a powerful stack for full-stack JavaScript development, and I'm learning it to build **real-world applications** and eventually become a **backend-focused developer**.
